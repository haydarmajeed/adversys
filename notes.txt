so the issue is that mistral requires a newer version of pydantic and langchain requires an older one for this to work so in this case I need to get rid of mistral ai as we have seen from this error:

mistralai package requires pydantic version >=2.5.2

when the files in the src directory were in the main directory they didnt need a src. not a . before the import statement to import the file because they were in the same directory but now that they are in the src directory despite still being in the same directory you need a src. or a . before the import statement (research)
TODO:

Bot for testing systematically

connect a database that will compile all of the text output by the threat model and store it by date

have a way to select from each of these dates on the copilot page 

when you select a date it adds that as context to the bot from the vector store but will probably just be the raw text as a POC at first

create a function to call the chatgpt api for multiple questions based on the date one date and output them to an excel file 

turn the above functionality into an excel plugin
